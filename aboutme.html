        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>An abridged introduction</h3>
                <p>Being born and raised in a Caribbean paradise tends to warp your worldview significantly. I recall being quite young and sitting in the back seat as my parents drove through the mountains in Puerto Rico and being able to see the coastline from my vantage point, and thinking—ignorantly, of course—“that is the end of the world!” Thinking back, I believe that, to some extent, that was true. All my experiences, my life events, my entire history was constrained by that ‘coastline’ by that barrier to the rest of the world. To me there was nothing more past that point. </p>
                <br><p>Meeting people from other cultures truly opened my eyes to how the rest of the world operated and thought. My insular life led me to believe that the world was centered on the island; which of course was not the case. While living in Puerto Rico the topic of ‘Puerto Rico’ was always at hand; however, after moving to the mainland I learned that it was not true. Puerto Rico: its history, culture, traditions—its food, were merely a blip in the world radar.</p><br>
            <h3>Where I stand</h3>
                <p>My name is <b>Alexis Omar López</b>, but I go by my middle name: “Omar.” Professionally, I currently form a part of the Cyberinfrastructure group at the University of Florida's Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) as a <i>Senior Scientific Systems Developer</i>. I was born in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico—a U.S. territory—but I have been living in the State of Florida for over a decade and a half. I am currently working towards the completion of my <i>Bachelor of Applied Science</i> (BAS) in Information Systems Technology (IST) with a concentration in Programming & Analysis. I hope this will help me have attain a well-rounded set of tools for my technical career.</p>
